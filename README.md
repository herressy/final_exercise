TASK:

"You will create a Python script that will process the images and descriptions and then update your company's online website to add the new products.
Once the task is complete, the supplier should be notified with an email that indicates the total weight of fruit (in lbs) that were uploaded. 
The email should have a PDF attached with the name of the fruit and its total weight (in lbs).
Finally, in parallel to the automation running, we want to check the health of the system and send an email if something goes wrong."
